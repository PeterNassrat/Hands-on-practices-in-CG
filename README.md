# Hands-on-practices-in-CG
Those are a collection of hands-on practices in Computer Graphics.\
They help learn the basics of Computer Graphics.\
They are written as webpages using HTML and Javascript languages and the WebGL systems for drawing 2D and 3D computer graphics.\
The name of the book that introduces the explanations is "WebGL Programming Guide".\
This book will take you step-by-step through the basics of how to draw 2D and 3D computer graphics using the WebGL system.\
I introduce an acknowledgment to the author of the book and to my professor who led me in this book to understand the content of the book.\
Thanks for reading!
